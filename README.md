# GRAPH CENTRALITY METRICS
 
 In this project, Betweenness and Closeness centrality metrics are calculated for the nodes of the two given graph data sets, Karate Club Network and Facebook social Network graphs.
 

1.	Betweenness Centrality
Betweenness centrality shows the strategic location of a node in a graph. Betweenness centrality of a node n is defined as the number of shortest paths going through the node n. For each pair of nodes, shortest paths between them are computed and the fraction of shortest paths passing through n is calculated. 

2.	Closeness Centrality
Closeness centrality depends on measure of how close a node is to the other nodes in the graph. A node in a more central location is considered closer to all other nodes. Closeness is calculated by taking the average length of the shortest paths between the node n.
